<p>Social media is probably the greatest issue of the Internet, and there are quite a few contenders, by the way.</p>
<p>Think about it for a moment: how much time do you spend &ldquo;interacting&rdquo; with people on social media compared to face-to-face interactions?
Furthermore, how much time do you spend staring at your phone on a daily basis?</p>
<p>If the answers are &ldquo;not much&rdquo;, then great for you, but statistically it is far more likely that you are in the other category, the category
of social media addicts. I do not use the word addiction lightly, for it is a serious condition which must be approached with utmost care
and consideration.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, social media is designed to create psychological addiction.</p>
<h1 id="algorithmic-addiction">Algorithmic addiction</h1>
<p>The use of psychologically addictive techniques to manipulate people into using certain products is much older than modern psychology.
People have been using advertisements and propaganda for centuries and over time various techniques were already well known and studied
even before psychology could come up with explanations for why they work.</p>
<p>The main difference between good old snake oil salesman of yore and your social media feed is in the potency. A travelling salesman
aiming to sell his good did not have much time to meet his audience - he had just entered a village, how could he possibly know
the psychological profiles of villagers? Social media, on the other hand, collects absurd amounts of data every second you use it.
Facebook and Instagram know exactly how many seconds you have spent looking at a funny meme, how many times you have visited a certain profile,
what kind of men or women you are into, what bothers you these days, who your friends are&hellip; It is scary to think about, but it probably knows
you better than you know yourself.</p>
<p>Highly sophisticated machine learning algorithms are then continually processing this data to build your optimal psychological profile and offer
you something akin to a four stage addiction model in which you are unwillingly sucked in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile: It knows your current mood and interests.</li>
<li>Trigger: Based on your profile, it sends an appropriate trigger, which could be a post, video, story, or even a random notification.</li>
<li>Action: This triggers your response and now you are stuck using the application (which provides even more data for an even better profile)</li>
<li>Reward: Your actions ultimately lead to a &ldquo;reward&rdquo;, perhaps you laughed at a funny meme or got a bit horny seeing a scantily clad woman, or even had
a pleasant conversation with your friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is quite obvious that each of these steps feeds into the others. Your usage provides data for psychological profiles which can be used to
trigger you into using the app, which in turn makes you feel good, which lets the app know more about you, which in turn leads to better triggers,
and so on&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="harsh-reality">Harsh reality</h1>
<p>Unlike other common sources of addiction, social media inherently does not seem as bad. It lets us engage with the world around us, meet new people,
find others with common interests; we can even let the algorithm choose our partner for us, what a wonderful world we live in!</p>
<p>And yet, in spite of all these apparent benefits, there is an interesting correlation between introducing Facebook to new countries and spikes in
teenage mental health issues. It tends to shorten attention span, since a large quantity of fast-paced rapidly changing content tends to
have a long-term effect on our brains (TikTok&rsquo;s model and its copies are especially guilty of this). It locks us in echo chambers of people we agree
with, which can have more long-term negative effects on our social life than any benefits, given the fact that the more time we spend stroking our egos
with people thousands of kilometres away from us, the less time we spend on meeting new people who live around us and just so happen to have opinions slightly
different from ours.</p>
<h2 id="islamic-perspective">Islamic perspective</h2>
<p>For a Muslim, all of it becomes even more evident. Muslims are responsible for their time, and although we certainly need to just rest from both worldly
and religious duties, even this time will be accounted for. Instead of relaxing our mind with some sleep, daydreaming, walking or even doing some soothing
yet productive activities such as reading useful books, social media provides passive overstimulation of the brain, the exact opposite of the intended effect.</p>
<p>It is full of sinful content which is hard to avoid even when you actively try; it encourages people to overshare their private lives and indulge in others&rsquo; lives,
which leads to envy, backbiting, slander and detoriation in interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Another dangerous effect is the ever higher presence of false information and various suspicious online &ldquo;scholars&rdquo; spreading mischief and sowing dissent among
the Ummah. Instead of focusing on proper Islamic education and learning from well educated and trustworthy scholars, people are served all kinds of
questionable content. This ties in well with the algorithmic nature of social media&rsquo;s information dissemination and the addictive effects thereof.</p>
<p>It is therefore evident that practically all the potential benefits of social media can be found elsewhere, while the negatives are still an ever present
threat on such platforms, which is why it would be much better to avoid using it.</p>
<h1 id="an-easy-solution">An easy solution</h1>
<p>Thank God there is a rather easy solution to the entire problem. It is very simple and consists of only a single step: delete social media.</p>
<p>That is all there is to it, just stop using it. Alright, perhaps it is not as easy as that, so I will also provide a few helpful intermediate steps.</p>
<p>First of all, recognising the problem is necessary before even attempting to stop anything. If you have not recognised the problem by this point of the article,
then I am sorry for wasting your time, please go back to clicking your &ldquo;Like&rdquo; buttons and scrolling through the videos.</p>
<p>Then, you will need to keep in mind the basic principles of how addiction works, which I have already mentioned above. You might notice that all it takes to
break the loop is to stop indulging in it, after which it will fall apart quite quickly - within a few months at most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile: By not using it, it will not know your current mood and interests.</li>
<li>Trigger: Triggers will be less relevant and they will reach you less.</li>
<li>Actions: Since the triggers are not there, you will have less of an incentive to use the platforms.</li>
<li>Reward: Without an action, there are no rewards, which will let the neural pathways slowly recover.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just deleting the applications from your phone and blocking them in your browser will oftentimes fail. This is because there is one more factor involved: investment.
You have invested time and effort in your social media: followers, likes, news and so on, all stem from your accounts. As long as your brain knows that it can
access those by reinstalling the applications and logging back in, it will do so.</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, you will need to commit even further by completely deleting your account. Once upon a time, deleting an Instagram account was as
simple as clicking a few buttons and entering your password. Nowadays, deleting an Instagram account (and almost all social media accounts, for that matter)
takes 30 days, &ldquo;in case you change your mind&rdquo;. Those sneaky bastards! There is a simple counter-strategy, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove your phone number (which you should not have provided in the first place) to eliminate any possibility of SMS-based recovery</li>
<li>Create a burner e-mail address for which you will not know the password (refer to next step) and make it the primary address of all accounts
you want to delete</li>
<li>Use a password manager to generate a random password which you can copy-paste (but can not memorise), change your password and use the newly generated password</li>
<li>Now, when you set your account for deletion, it will usually require you to login within 30 days; but since you do not know your password and since both the e-mail
and phone number can not be used, you are effectively already locked out of your account forever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your accounts are gone, all the investment will be gone with them. This way, you will not feel like you are missing out and any attempt to return will be
soon quelled by the fact that your brain knows it will have to spend a lot of time to restart with a new account.</p>
<p>Finally, for the sake of long-term happiness and safety from relapse, you will need to fill in all the time you have previously been wasting on social media.
Start reading long and useful books, writing, learning new things, engaging in hobbies, <em>actually</em> meeting new people and doing good both for yourself
and the world around you. It goes a long way, I promise.</p>
