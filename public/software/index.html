<p>I write code that I find interesting, beneficial, challenging or all of the above. Most of the time, it&rsquo;s projects
that are way out of my humble capabilities, so I end up leaving them abandoned.</p>
<p>I prefer simple programs doing simple things well. However, I find that minimalism in code itself is usually a bad
idea and therefore I oftentimes use up more lines of code than I really need.</p>
<h1 id="active">Active</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>vactija - Vaktija.ba CLI frontend, written in C, supporting Linux and macOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whitaker-words-jsonisator - Not really a program as much as it&rsquo;s a data repository for Whitaker&rsquo;s WORDS
converted to JSON, used by another project of mine. Written in Python as a horribly boring script.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="inactive">Inactive</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lavinija - Reimplementation of Whitaker&rsquo;s WORDS in Kotlin. It turned out that Latin dictionaries are very hard
and time consuming to make, no wonder Whitaker spent a good part of his retirement on it. Supports rudimentary search
functions through a CLI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ematura.ba - Website front-end together with an API written in TypeScript (JavaScript originally, before I decided
to keep my sanity) with React/Express for the purpose of providing high school students of Tuzla canton a chance to practise
for their matriculation exams. It is basically finished and only needs about a thousand questions to be entered manually.
Since I absolutely have neither time nor will to do that anytime soon, I consider it an inactive project. Besides, it does need
a redesign, preferably by someone who actually knows what they are doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ouroboros - Bukkit plugin I wrote as an admin on a Minecraft server once we needed a replacement for an old unsupported plugin. It follows
all the best OOP practices™ and even includes an abstract factory™ factory™ somewhere in the code. Basically, it&rsquo;s a fancy key-value database
(supporting MySQL &ndash; specific requirements for the server I worked on &ndash; and YAML) which keeps track of player lives and prevents them
from losing their inventory contents in case of death (just like Super Mario lives).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PixelWarzone - SpongeForge + Pixelmon mod plugin I wrote as an admin for the same server. This time, it emulated a &ldquo;warzone&rdquo; (is that
how the new CoD kids call it nowadays?) mechanic by forcing the players to fight each other and lose their Pokemon if they lost (thus emulating
the looting mechanism). Thanks also go to Gershon for writing a good chunk of the codebase and adding several new features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
