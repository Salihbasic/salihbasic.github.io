I was born in year 2003 in Tuzla and I currently live in Srebrenik. I attended
First elementary school in Srebrenik and then a gymnasium at
Polytechnic high school in Srebrenik, which I graduated as a valedictorian in 2022,
after which, that same year, I started studying mathematics at the Faculty 
of Natural sciences and Mathematics at the University of Tuzla and I am currently
a second year student.

I fell in love with programming already in elementary school and ever since then
I have been continuously studying and developing my programming skills. 
Most of my experience has been working with the JVM platform (Java/Kotlin/Clojure)
and technologies based on it, but I also develop programs in C, Python, 
JavaScript/TypeScript and LISP (particularly Scheme).

I actively speak English and German, while at the same time having a reading
capability in Latin.

Outside of my academic interests, I also enjoy/love/study debate, philosophy, 
islam, linguistics and literature, as well as coffee and tea.
