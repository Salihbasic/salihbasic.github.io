I am Mahir Salihbašić. I live in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tuzla canton, where I study Applied mathematics at the University of Tuzla, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.

I am passionate about solving problems by applying mathematical rigour and precision to the problem domain. My academic interests lie in the areas of optimisation, optimal control, differential games, and in general, dynamical systems. Ever since elementary school, I'm a self-taught programmer. Over the years, I've acquired significant experience, working on personal, academic, and recently, industry projects.

While I had more free time, I used to be active in debate competitions, something I've enjoyed since high school, even achieving high rankings on national level.
Nowadays, I merely carry the lessons learned by engaging in active conversation with people over topics I'd never have though I'd discuss.

I enjoy reading, almost anything goes, but XIX century German and Russian literature have a special place on my bookshelves.

I take an amateurish interest in various disciplines, including but not limited to military history; historical, comparative and computational linguistics; aviation; 
navigation; table tennis and chess.

My native language is Bosnian, but I can speak English fluently, German rather well, and I have a basic knowledge of Russian and Arabic. I also self-taught Latin, enough to read and translate post-medieval scientific works.
