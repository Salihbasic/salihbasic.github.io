Listed below are some of my projects that I have worked on in the previous years
and released online.

## vactija 
[GitHub](https://github.com/Salihbasic/vactija)

A command-line vaktija (Islamic prayer timetable) implemented in C for Linux and macOS.
Uses data provided by [vaktija.ba](https://vaktija.ba), so it is specific to Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Easily integrated in scripts.

## Lavinija
[GitHub](https://github.com/Salihbasic/Lavinija)

An abandoned porting project of Whitaker's WORDS - a Latin dictionary/lexical analysis tool - to a
more modern Kotlin version. Still has the absolutely basic functionality, but I lost interest in it.

### whitaker-words-jsonisator
[GitHub](https://github.com/Salihbasic/whitaker-words-jsonisator)

Written in Python as a script to be used for Lavinija. Takes all the original WORDS data and
converts it into JSON format for easier integration with modern libraries.

## csvn
[GitHub](https://github.com/Salihbasic/csvn)

Rudimentary CSV parser written in ANSI C inspired by jsmn's approach to JSON data.
Supports RFC 4180 based CSV and with additional potential customisations.

## PMFStableMarriage
[GitHub](https://github.com/Salihbasic/PMFStableMarriage)

An implementation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm provided as a Python package. It was originally
written for a *Mathematical introduction to computer science* class at *PMF Tuzla* so that I
and my classmates could visualize the algorithm and analyse it in an easier manner. It can, however,
serve as a solid backend for any project needing it.

## Ouroboros
[GitHub](https://github.com/Salihbasic/Ouroboros)

A Spigot plugin written in Java for a private Minecraft server. Adds a player lives mechanic
inspired by games like Super Mario, with support for YAML and SQL based data storage. Unmaintained.

## pixel-warzone
[GitHub](https://github.com/stein-ein/PixelWarzone)

A Pixelmon/Sponge plugin written in Java for a private Minecraft server in collaboration with another developer.
Implements a free-for-all zone in which players may lose their Pokemon if they lose a battle.
