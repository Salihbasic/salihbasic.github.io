Back in the 1970s, a Yugoslavian social scientist, Đuro Šušnjić, published
a book with a rather peculiar title: *Ribari ljudskih duša: ideje manipulacije
i manipulacija idejama*. Its main idea was an exposition of commonplace
outright manipulatory tactics used by various interest groups to influence
and control everyday lives of people, all in order to peddle products, spread
political ideas and, above all, acquire some kind of power.

Quite ironically, its content is spread with Marxist ideas (this was in Yugoslavia
after all) of class warfare and the poor peasants being opressed, now psychologically,
by the burgeoisie. Perhaps this was intentional, just like the book's failure to 
fully press on state propaganda machinery (even though it consistently mentions it
from time to time), since there was still a very real danger of censorship, and so
authors of all backgrounds had to undergo self-censorship, an interesting phenomenon 
that we shall come back to soon enough.

One particularly insidious notion that dr. Šušnjić notes is the subtlety of
influence, as written in the preamble:
> a) Children memorise even that which they don't understand, b) and they unconsciously
> repeat that which they don't understand, c) and they are learning even when they are 
> unaware of it, d) their behaviour is controlled by unconscious factors, e) they 
> accept messages even when they are incapable of understanding them, f) they are
> unaware of the unconscious, g) and unconscious thoughts come forth in certain states 
> (like sleep) to consciousness.

No doubt, none of these are new ideas in and of themselves. That the unconscious thoughts
have an effect on our everyday conscious thoughts and feelings was a central part of
XIX and early XX century psychology, especially seen in psychoanalysis. Operant conditioning
was also a field of serious research since the early XX century, especially after B. F. Skinner's
work. When you combine these two, you get powerful tools of influence and control based on
precise, scientifically tested methodologies, that can easily affect an entire group of people
without them being aware of it.

Nowadays, we have people like B. J. Fogg (who wrote an excellent book on the topic
*Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do*) leading Stanford courses
on *behaviour design*. While dr. Fogg is nominally concerned about the ethics of his "*captology*",
a term he uses to describe "computers as persuasive technology" research, it soon became very obvious
that many of his students, who went on to create billion dollar social media and tech giants, such as
Instagram's Mike Krieger, had nothing close to qualms about abuse of captology. In its core, however,
captology is exactly what dr. Šušnjić was talking about -- a combination of behaviouristic methods
acting on our unconscious minds in order to influence certain groups of people to act in another group's
interests.

## Models of influence

If you go on LinkedIn and search for psychologists at \<insert social media company\>, you will find
a small dozen of them. That is because, as dr. Šušnjić puts it, "*symbols (ideas) are weapons*" of today.
Behind all the engineering and design that is put in the network's physical manifestation, there is also
a group of psychologists, marketing experts (basically the same thing) and user experience designers
(basically the same thing) figuring out how to get you addicted on their product.

Towards that end, there are two ways in which this occurs: behavioural and ideological.
